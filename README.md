# Day 3 of Alura's Immersion! üöÄ

This project is part of Alura's Back-End Immersion, focusing on building a robust API using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. Over the immersion, the project evolves to include more advanced functionalities and database integrations.

## üìã Features

- Starts a server that listens on port 3000.
- GET `/posts`: Retrieves all posts from the database.
- **Day 2 Updates**:
  - Created a mock database for posts.
  - Prepared MongoDB Atlas for integration by generating a connection link.
  - Added routes to interact with the mock data.
- **Day 3 Updates**:
  - Configured the first cluster, database, and collection on **MongoDB Atlas**.
  - Introduced **environment variables** for managing sensitive data.
  - Connected the database to the API using a connection string.
  - Refactored the GET `/posts` route to fetch data from MongoDB.
  - Created a clear project structure:
    - **Models** for database interaction.
    - **Controllers** to handle logic and requests.
    - **Routes** to manage API endpoints.
    - **Config** for centralized configuration.
