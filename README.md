# Day 1 of Alura's Immersion! 🚀

This project is part of Alura's Back-End Immersion, focusing on building a robust API using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. Over the immersion, the project evolves to include more advanced functionalities and database integrations.

## 📋 Features

- Starts a server that listens on port 3000.
- GET `/posts`: Returns a list of mock posts.
- GET `/posts/:id`: Retrieves a specific post by its ID.
- **Day 2 Updates**:
  - Created a mock database for posts.
  - Prepared MongoDB Atlas for integration by generating a connection link.
  - Added routes to interact with the mock data.
