# üì¶ Alura's Back-End Immersion Project

Welcome to the **Back-End Immersion** project developed during Alura's Back-End Immersion. This project showcases a robust RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It includes file upload functionality, image processing, and advanced database interactions, culminating in a deployment to **Google Cloud**.

## üåü Project Overview

This API is designed to manage posts, supporting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The core functionalities revolve around handling post data, including image uploads, data storage, and retrieval, with a MongoDB Atlas database.

The API is fully hosted on Google Cloud, ensuring high availability and easy access. You can interact with the deployed version through the following link:

## üöÄ Features

-   **File Uploads**: Upload images associated with posts using the `/upload` route.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Manage posts using dedicated routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting.
-   **MongoDB Integration**: Data is persistently stored and managed using a **MongoDB Atlas** database.
-   **Image Processing**: Use of advanced image handling with Google Generative AI (Gemini) to generate descriptions for uploaded images.
-   **Google Cloud Deployment**: The API is deployed on Google Cloud for scalability and reliability.

### **Step-by-Step Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    
	  `git clone https://github.com/ricardotemporal/your-repo-name.git`
	  `cd your-repo-name` 
    
2.  **Install Dependencies**

	`npm install` 
    
4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    
    -   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
